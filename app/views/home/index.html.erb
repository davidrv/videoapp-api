<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This project is meant to create video playlists for your kids.</p>

<p>The idea is that you can create a different number of lists based on your subscription plan.</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 for the free plan with a maximum of 15 videos</li>
    <li>10 for the free plan with a maximum of 1.000 videos</li>
    <li>9.999 for the free plan with a maximum of 999.999 videos</li>
</ul>

<p><b>So:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>You can create a new list with the New List button.</li>
    <li>You can create new items (videos) with the New Item button. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate from the Lists table through the "Items" link of a given list and the button will be there</li>
            <li>Just paste a YouTube video URL in the form's New item URL input field to create a new item. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mny1kAxF2zQ</li>
            <li>It will automatically extract the video info and store it in the database.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Extra:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you edit the name of a List, a new ListVersion entry will be generated. Click on the History button on the Lists table.</li>
<li>You can update your Subscription plan from the Edit Registration page in the header. Hurry up! Itâ€™s free for now ;)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Next steps:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The idea is to build an API later. So, all these lists are available from mobile native apps, and you can decide what your kids can watch!</li>
        <ul><li>A couple of temp endpoints were added a long time ago. Just to start building the native mobile apps. Donâ€™t look at them, please ðŸ™ˆ</li></ul>
    <li>System tests. The UI is not tested at all. Some work to do there ðŸ¥¶</li>
    <li>Same as design / layout. Quickly added Bootstrap from the CDN to have a basic layout for now.</li>
</ul>
